# Using Your GitHub Meals in PlatePilot

## Overview

Your PlatePilot app now supports loading meals from your GitHub repository! I've added support for new meal categories and included example meals. Now you need to replace the examples with your actual uploaded meals.

## Your GitHub Repository Structure

Based on your existing setup, your meals should be organized in branches like:
- `breakfast/` - Breakfast meals
- `Lunch_meals/` - Lunch meals
- `Dinner_meals/` - Dinner meals
- `Snack_meals/` - Snack meals
- `Nonveg_meals/` - Non-vegetarian meals
- `Vegan_meals/` - Vegan meals

## Step 1: Check Your Uploaded Meals

Go to your GitHub repository `muraza6/meal-images` and check what meals you've uploaded. Each meal should have:
- Card image (e.g., `meal_name_card.png`)
- Detail image (e.g., `meal_name_detail.png`)

## Step 2: Update MealRepository.kt

Open `app/src/main/java/com/bodycalc/platepilot/data/repository/MealRepository.kt`

## Step 3: Replace Example Meals

Find the section marked `===== ADD YOUR GITHUB MEALS HERE =====` and replace the example meals with your actual meals.

### Example Format for Your Meals:

```kotlin
// Replace this example:
Meal(
    name = "Mediterranean Chicken Salad",
    type = MealType.LUNCH,
    description = "Fresh Mediterranean-style chicken salad with herbs and olive oil",
    ingredients = "[\"Chicken breast\", \"Cucumber\", \"Tomatoes\", \"Feta cheese\", \"Olives\", \"Olive oil\", \"Oregano\"]",
    recipe = "1. Grill chicken breast\\n2. Chop vegetables\\n3. Mix with olive oil and herbs\\n4. Add feta cheese",
    calories = 380,
    protein = 35,
    carbs = 12,
    fats = 22,
    imageUrl = GitHubImageManager.getLunchImageUrl("mediterranean_chicken_salad_card.png"),
    detailImageUrl = GitHubImageManager.getLunchImageUrl("mediterranean_chicken_salad_detail.png"),
    isCloudImage = true
),

// With your actual meal:
Meal(
    name = "Your Meal Name",
    type = MealType.LUNCH,  // Change to BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, or SNACK
    description = "Description of your meal",
    ingredients = "[\"Ingredient 1\", \"Ingredient 2\", \"Ingredient 3\"]",
    recipe = "1. Step one\\n2. Step two\\n3. Step three",
    calories = 350,  // Actual calories
    protein = 30,    // Protein in grams
    carbs = 25,      // Carbs in grams
    fats = 15,       // Fats in grams
    imageUrl = GitHubImageManager.getLunchImageUrl("your_meal_card.png"),
    detailImageUrl = GitHubImageManager.getLunchImageUrl("your_meal_detail.png"),
    isCloudImage = true
),
```

## Step 4: Update Meal Plan Pattern

If you add new meals, update the `mealPlanPattern` in the `ensureSevenDayMealPlans()` function to include your new meal IDs.

Current pattern uses meals 1-16. If you add more meals, update the pattern accordingly.

## Step 5: Image Naming Convention

Make sure your GitHub images follow this naming pattern:
- **Card images**: `meal_name_card.png` (shown in meal list)
- **Detail images**: `meal_name_detail.png` (shown in meal details)

### Examples:
- `chicken_curry_card.png` / `chicken_curry_detail.png`
- `vegetable_biryani_card.png` / `vegetable_biryani_detail.png`
- `fruit_smoothie_card.png` / `fruit_smoothie_detail.png`

## Step 6: Test Your Meals

1. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

2. **Uninstall the app** from your device (to clear old data)

3. **Install the new APK:**
   ```bash
   adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

4. **Check the app** - your new meals should appear in the meal planning screens

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
- Check that image filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify images are in the correct GitHub branch/folder
- Make sure images are publicly accessible

### Meals Not Appearing
- Check that meal IDs in the pattern match your meal order
- Verify the MealType is correct (BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, SNACK)
- Clear app data and reinstall

### Nutrition Data Issues
- Ensure calories, protein, carbs, fats are positive numbers
- Use accurate nutrition data from reliable sources

## Adding More Meal Categories

If you need more categories, add them to `GitHubImageManager.kt`:

```kotlin
fun getDessertImageUrl(imagePath: String): String {
    return getImageUrl("Dessert_meals", imagePath)
}
```

## Example: Complete Meal Addition

Here's how to add a complete meal:

```kotlin
Meal(
    name = "Butter Chicken",
    type = MealType.DINNER,
    description = "Creamy and rich Indian butter chicken curry",
    ingredients = "[\"Chicken\", \"Butter\", \"Cream\", \"Tomatoes\", \"Garam masala\", \"Ginger\", \"Garlic\"]",
    recipe = "1. Marinate chicken in yogurt and spices\\n2. Cook tomatoes into paste\\n3. Add butter and cream\\n4. Simmer chicken in sauce",
    calories = 520,
    protein = 35,
    carbs = 15,
    fats = 38,
    imageUrl = GitHubImageManager.getDinnerImageUrl("butter_chicken_card.png"),
    detailImageUrl = GitHubImageManager.getDinnerImageUrl("butter_chicken_detail.png"),
    isCloudImage = true
),
```

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Android Studio Logcat for error messages
2. Verify GitHub image URLs are accessible
3. Test with a simple meal first
4. Make sure all syntax is correct

Your meals from GitHub will now be integrated into your PlatePilot app! 🍽️</content>
